# Keycloak - configuring for production on Codesphere

## What Is Keycloak?
Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution that provides robust authentication and authorization services for web and mobile applications. Developed by Red Hat, Keycloak simplifies the implementation of security features by offering a centralized and customizable authentication server. It supports various authentication protocols, including OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML, allowing developers to integrate single sign-on (SSO) capabilities seamlessly. Keycloak's versatile features include user federation, role-based access control, and social identity provider integration, enabling organizations to secure their applications with ease. Its user-friendly administration console facilitates the management of users, groups, and client applications, making it a popular choice for enterprises seeking a comprehensive identity management solution.
